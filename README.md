Secure your WordPress login with a simple email-based 6-digit OTP after password. Choose Admins only or All users. Includes resend with cooldown and on-screen countdown.

== Description ==
**Email OTP Login** adds a second login step via a 6-digit One-Time Password (OTP) sent to the user‚Äôs account email **after** a correct username/password. It‚Äôs lightweight, uses native `wp_mail()`, stores OTPs hashed in transients, and provides a clean, accessible six-box input UI with auto-advance and paste support.

**Highlights**
- 6-digit OTP, **10-minute** expiry
- **5 attempts** per code
- **Resend** with **60s cooldown** + visible countdown
- Scope control: **Admins only** (default) or **All users**
- Clean UI: six inputs (auto-advance, backspace/arrow navigation, paste)
- **No third-party service** required; local assets only
- **i18n ready** (`email-otp-login`)

**Privacy**  
No data is sent to third parties. OTPs are hashed and stored temporarily (WordPress transients) and removed on success/expiry.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/email-otp-login/` and activate.
2. Ensure your site can send emails (configure SMTP plugin if needed).
3. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Email OTP Login** and select scope: *Admins only* (default) or *All users*.
4. Log out and in to test: after entering password, you‚Äôll be prompted for the 6-digit email code.

**Caching / Firewalls**
- Do **not** cache `wp-login.php` or the OTP screen.
- If a WAF/CDN is in use, allow `wp-login.php?action=otp&resend=1`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I‚Äôm not receiving the OTP email. =
Check spam/junk. Verify SMTP with a plugin (e.g., WP Mail SMTP). Confirm user email is correct. Some hosts rate-limit `wp_mail()`; SMTP is recommended.

= Can I require OTP for all users? =
Yes. In **Settings ‚Üí Email OTP Login**, pick **All users**.

= Does this replace passwords? =
No. OTP is a second factor **after** a valid password.

= Can I customize the sender name? =
Yes. Set the `FROM_NAME` constant in the plugin or use your SMTP plugin‚Äôs ‚ÄúFrom Name‚Äù.

= Multisite support? =
Works per site; network activation is fine. Each site controls its own settings.

= Accessibility =
Inputs support auto-advance, backspace, arrow keys, and full-code paste. The resend link becomes active when the countdown reaches zero.

== Screenshots ==
1. OTP verification screen with six inputs and ‚ÄúVerify and Continue‚Äù.
2. Resend link with visible countdown and ‚ÄúBack to Login‚Äù.
